# [The Odin Project: NodeJS Course](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/nodejs-inventory-application)

View the end result at [fly.io](https://bored-programmer-api.fly.dev/).

The goal of this project was to create our own version of the [Local Library walkthrough.](https://github.com/FatCatLikesBeer/express-locallibrary-tutorial) We were expected to create an inventory management system for some arbitrary customer.

I figure that was a bit uninteresting, so I decided to create something similiar and simpler to [Bored API.](https://www.boredapi.com/)
